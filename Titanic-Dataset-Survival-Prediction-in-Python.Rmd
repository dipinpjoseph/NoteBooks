** Work in Progress **

## Problem Statement

In this notebook we are dealing with one of the most common classification problems - "Predicting survival rate of Titanic passengers based on available characteristics".

This problem is hosted as a Kaggle competition and can be accessed by https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic.

In short, the goal is to create a binary classification model which predict if a person survives or not in titanic shipwreck based on features like their age, sex, financial situation etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Here, we look into the train data more deeply. We starts with Summary statistics, NA resolve, Correlation check and so on.


### Importing Dataset

The titanic dataset is freely available on path - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

```{python}
#! pip3 install kaggle

# Kaggle API stuffs
from kaggle.api.kaggle_api_extended import KaggleApi
api = KaggleApi()
api.authenticate()

# Downloading titanic dataset
api.competition_download_files('titanic')

# Unzip titanic.zip
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile("titanic.zip","r") as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("titanic_data")
    
# Loading Dataset
#! pip3 install pandas
import pandas as pd

df_train = pd.read_csv('titanic_data/train.csv')
df_test = pd.read_csv('titanic_data/test.csv')
print(df_train.head())
print(df_test.head())

```
```{python}
# Summary of Train Data
df_train.describe()
```

```{python}
# Visualization - Missing Values
#! pip3 install missingno
import missingno as msno
# %matplotlib inline

msno.matrix(df_train)

```
