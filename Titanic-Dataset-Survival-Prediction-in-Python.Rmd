** Work in Progress **

## Problem Statement

In this notebook we are dealing with one of the most common classification problems - "Predicting survival rate of Titanic passengers based on available characteristics".

This problem is hosted as a Kaggle competition and can be accessed by https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic.

In short, the goal is to create a binary classification model which predict if a person survives or not in titanic shipwreck based on features like their age, sex, financial situation etc.
